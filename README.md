## Albert Plugins

A grab-bag of plugins that I have come up with to keep productivity higher

### Spell

A simple speller that uses [aspell](http://aspell.net/) under the hood.  You'll
need to ensure that you have it on your operating system for this plugin to
work.  To install the plugin simply copy the contents inside of `spell/` into
your Albert python modules directory.
